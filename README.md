# A-Path-Dependent-Multi-Period-Rebalancing-Model-for-Stochastic-U-Shaped-Disassembly-Lines
A mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model for multi-period, path-dependent rebalancing of U-shaped disassembly lines.
The model incorporates a chance constraint to manage stochastic task times and minimizes task relocation and workstation operating costs amid changing cycle times. 

# Instances 
The instances were mostly obtained from the literature. 
P10-OR obtained from [paper link](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318192805_An_improved_gravitational_search_algorithm_for_profit-oriented_partial_disassembly_line_balancing_problem)
P22-OR, P47-OR, P60-OR, and P73-OR were obtained from kalaycilar et al. 2016 [paper link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221715008279)
P133-OR was generated by combining the precedence relations of P60-OR and P73-OR.

The task times of the P22-OR, P47-OR, P60-OR, P73-OR, and P133-OR were regenerated randomly.
