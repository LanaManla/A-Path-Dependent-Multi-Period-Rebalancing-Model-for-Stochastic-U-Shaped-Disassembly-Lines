# A-Path-Dependent-Multi-Period-Rebalancing-Model-for-Stochastic-U-Shaped-Disassembly-Lines
A mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model for multi-period, path-dependent rebalancing of U-shaped disassembly lines.
The model incorporates chance constraints to manage stochastic task times and minimizes task relocation and workstation operating costs amid changing cycle times.
